/// accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying
/// takes place when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance benefits.

/// Note that this implementation is pretty limited and the benefits are only apparent when reading forward and
/// consecutively â€“ e.g. when downloading the resource by chunks. The buffer is ignored when reading backward or far
